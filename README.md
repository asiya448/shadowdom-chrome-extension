# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Requirement

-	Create a React application which would run as a Chrome Extension/Plugin.
-	This is the URL for a page which contains nested Shadow DOM HTML elements -http://watir.com/examples/shadow_dom.html
-	Application should be able to highlight each HTML element inside the Shadow dom with ‘2px solid green’ border’.
-	Once highlighted, HTML elements highlighted on click should be added to a list inside the Chrome Extension/Plugin.
-	Use Chrome API for communication between the Webpage and Chrome Extension/Plugin.
-	There should be a Delete Icon next to each HTML element item added to the list to delete that specific item.

NOTES 

1-	Cover all edge case scenarios.
2-	Focus should be on writing clean code with DRY and SOLID principles.

Bonus: Write Test Cases.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
